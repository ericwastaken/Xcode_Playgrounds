# Xcode_Playgrounds
A repo to store my Xcode Playgrounds for my reference and for anyone else's. All code in this repo is in Swift intended to be run in Apple Xcode Playgrounds, though the classes and methods should work fine in regular projects. As of last edit of this file, these were tested in Xcode 8 and the syntax is *mostly* Swift 3.

## Why?
Folks want to see examples of code and style. This is that!

## Is this novel?
Not really. These are just algorithms and so, they are well known ways to solve problems. I'm not making claim to any of this. This is just 'my practice' for said algorithms, and some might not actually work well or be correct.

## Are all these correct?
Probably not. I'm not making the claim that all of this is correct or 'best implementation'. These are just my playgrounds, my learning. If it helps others, cool!

## Pull requests from others?
Sure, I guess if you feel compelled, go for it. However, it might benefit more people if you instead make PRs against the Swift Algorithm Club (see below.) My repo is probably not seen by many people. :-)

## There is better stuff out there
Please check out [Swift Algorithm Club by Ray Wenderlich](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club) and contributors. Honestly, a lot of my algorithms are inspired by that repo.
